# Events Calendar Plugin

A plugin inspired by the [Full Calendar Plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-full-calendar)
but altered to fit my needs. This includes the styling from which acts as a base for this plugin.

## Possible

- Day Planner plugin support
  - Upgrade line item events to files
- Sidebar calendar view?
- From ICS file
  - Click ical to create a local file
